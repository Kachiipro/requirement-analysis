# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Requirement analysis as an important phase in software development lifecycle 

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is an important phase or process where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed to ensure a clear and mutual understanding between  the developers and stakeholders of what the system should do and how it should perform.Requirement analysis is the first step of the software development process and software development life cycle (SDLC). Requirement analysis ensures Clarity and Understanding,Scope Definition,Basis for Design and Development,Cost and Time Estimation and Quality Assurance.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important:

- Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system. Right analysis creates good and strong foundation for the project.Getting this phase right means avoiding costly mistakes later on.
- It speeds up development time and Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Requirement analysis documentation ensures easy communication between stakeholders and developers.
- It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
