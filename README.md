# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Requirement analysis as an important phase in software development lifecycle 

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is an important phase or process where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed to ensure a clear and mutual understanding between  the developers and stakeholders of what the system should do and how it should perform.Requirement analysis is the first step of the software development process and software development life cycle (SDLC). Requirement analysis ensures Clarity and Understanding,Scope Definition,Basis for Design and Development,Cost and Time Estimation and Quality Assurance.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system. Right analysis creates good and strong foundation for the project.Getting this phase right means avoiding costly mistakes later on.
- It speeds up development time and Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Requirement analysis documentation ensures easy communication between stakeholders and developers.
- It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- Requirement Gathering: process of conducting Interviews  with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations,Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience,Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements,Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs,reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
- Requirement Elicitation: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements,holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements and Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
- Requirement Documentation: these involves Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements, Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective and Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling: entails prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project, assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints and also Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
- Requirement Validation: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness,Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards and Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.


# Types of Requirements

##  Functional Requirements:
 Functional requirements are product features that developers must implement to enable the users to achieve their goals. They define the basic system behavior under specific conditions.
- **Functional Requirements Examples**: property search, user authentication, user registration, property listing, password recovery  and booking system.
## Non-functional Requirements: 
Non- functional are intended to specify ‘system qualities,’ various systems attributes that are not directly related to their functionality. These attributes do not tell what the system does but how well it does it. In contrast, functional requirements are expressed as Capabilities, Features, and Stories, which define what the system does in response to various inputs. Although they may seem subtle, NFRs are just as vital to system success. Failing to meet NFRs can result in systems that do not meet the needs of the business, Customers, market, or applicable regulations or standards.
- **Non-Functional Requirements Examples**:
- Performance: How fast a system should respond to requests
-  Scalability: How well a system can handle an increase in users or workload
-  Security: How well a system protects against unauthorized access and data breaches
-  Usability: How easy a system is to use Maintainability: How easy it is to update and modify the system
